Many programmers search for online examples when designing neural networks.

00:00:04.989 --> 00:00:12.513
However, it's time-consuming to identify desired information from search results and compare design choices in different models.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:19.003
We propose a novel interface for exploring the common and uncommon design choices in a large collection of models.

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.003
This interface includes

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.507
(1) a faceted browser to identify relevant models,

00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:25.507
(2) the distribution of different layers,

00:00:25.507 --> 00:00:27.511
(3) an overview of different model structures, and

00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:30.014
(4) the distribution of hyper parameters.
