<p>I design, build and evaluate systems for comprehending and interacting with population-level structure and trends in large code and data corpora. I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard Paulson School of Engineering & Applied Sciences and the Stanley A. Marks & William H. Marks Professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, specializing in human-computer interaction. At MIT, I earned a PhD and MEng in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a BS in Electrical Science and Engineering. Before joining Harvard, I was a postdoctoral scholar in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I received the Berkeley Institute for Data Science Moore/Sloan Data Science Fellowship.</p>
